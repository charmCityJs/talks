<!--
Use the form below to submit a talk to CharmCityJS.  Please feel free to submit any talk idea you have so long as it has a loose association to Javascript or Javascript developers.  Talks could be anything from a new technology you are interested in, to a fun technology related personal project, to how to be a better developer. If you have talk related question please visit the #give-a-talk channel on our slack.

Once submitted our team of moderators will review your talk and notify you a few weeks before the event for which your talk is selected.  Talks should be between 1 and 15 minutes in length. Do not leave time at the end of your talk for a Q&A as we actively discourage that in favor of one on one Q&A time after your talk is over. Also, while we appreciate your submission for a talk, submission of the talk is not guarantee of acceptance.  Finally, CharmCityJS may record and distribute your talk and/or pictures of you and your talk and submitting your talk is acceptance of us doing so. Recordings/images, if made, will only ever be made freely available through CharmCityJs and never sold or otherwise distributed. Ping us via email (team@charmcityjs.com) or twitter (@charmcityjs) if you have questions.
